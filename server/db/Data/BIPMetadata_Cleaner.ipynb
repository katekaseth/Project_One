The Graduate Student Accept Offer Survey collects information regarding the factors influencing applicants&rsquo; decision to attend UW. For example, applicants are asked how program reputation, diversity, post-graduation employment opportunities, tuition cost, funding, and other factors affected their graduate school selection. Applicants indicating funding as \"very important\" or \"critically important\" are asked to provide information regarding the best funding options offered by their best alternate institution, which is compared to UW&rsquo;s offer. Applicants are also prompted to rate their satisfaction with the application process, if they were able to visit campus prior to making an acceptance decision, and the highest level of education achieved by their parents and/or guardians. This survey consists of ten questions. Nine questions are incorporated into the survey. The tenth question elicits a free text response from applicants and can be viewed within MyGradProgram. A response to any, not all, of the ten questions is considered a valid survey submission for the purposes of response rate/number of surveys completed. These data are used for assessment and strategic/program planning by the Graduate School, Professional and Continuing Education (PCE), and academic programs. The revised Graduate Student Accept Offer Survey was developed by the Graduate School Survey Committee and in consultation with PCE, the Office of Educational Assessment, and UW Libraries. The survey was first administered in autumn quarter 2013 and revised in June 2015. What are the measures we are tracking? The dashboard tracks survey answers as a percentage of total responses to each survey question (e.g. percentage of respondents answering \"yes\" versus \"no\" to a given question). The survey also contains Likert scale questions reporting both percentages and scale number averages (represented by a black dot on the scale) using a dual axis. What is the period we are looking at? The response rate dashboard depicts the annual completion rates of survey responses by academic year, which can be filtered to specific quarters. All other dashboards present the survey question responses in aggregate for all years. Specific years and quarters can be displayed for all questions using the year and quarter filters. The default is to display all the data without filters pre-applied. The data will be refreshed annually after April 15<sup>th</sup>, which is the date applicants must accept or decline an offer of admission at UW and most other academic institutions. Where does the data come from? Graduate Student Accept Offer Survey data are obtained from the UW&rsquo;s Enterprise Data Warehouse courtesy of UW Data &amp; Analytics.',\n",
       " 'The Graduate Student Decline Offer Survey Dashboard displays responses to survey questions from the Graduate Student Decline Offer Survey. Students take this survey at the time they decline their offer of enrollment for graduate studies at UW in MyGradProgram. Dashboard users are able to filter and break down the data based on academic characteristics of interest (e.g. college, department, major) and demographic characteristics of interest (e.g. degree level, residency, ethnicity, gender, etc.). The filters allow the user to view data on only specific populations and breakdowns give users the ability to visually compare data from different groups. The dashboard also displays survey response rates segmented by academic year. The Graduate Student Decline Offer Survey collects information regarding the factors influencing applicants&rsquo; decision not to attend UW. For example, applicants are asked how program reputation, diversity, post-graduation employment opportunities, tuition cost, funding, and other factors affected their graduate school selection. Applicants indicating funding as \"very important\" or \"critically important\" are asked to provide information regarding the best funding options offered by their best alternate institution, which is compared to UW&rsquo;s offer. Applicants are also prompted to rate their satisfaction with the application process, if they were able to visit campus prior to making an acceptance decision, and the highest level of education achieved by their parents and/or guardians. This survey consists of 21 questions. 17 questions are incorporated into the survey. The questions not included in the dashboard elicit a free text response from applicants and can be viewed within MyGradProgram. A response to any, not all, of the questions is considered a valid survey submission for the purposes of response rate/number of surveys completed. It is important to note the questions asked in this survey are divided into three categories. A banner at the top of each dashboard describes the applicant pool responding to each question. <ul> <li>Questions all respondents are asked to answer.</li> <li>Questions asked of respondents attending an alternate academic institution.</li> <li>Questions asked of respondents not pursuing graduate studies at this time.</li> </ul> These data are used for assessment and strategic/program planning by the Graduate School, Professional and Continuing Education (PCE), and academic programs.

       " 'The Overview of Research Total Expenditures dashboard helps users to understand trends in total research expenditures amounts (nominal or inflation-adjusted) over time, broken down by federal/non-federal sources, direct/indirect, and expenditure type categories. The data that populate the dashboard are sourced from the Research Administration Data (RAD) tables in the EDWPresentation database. What is the time period for the data? The dashboard time period covers a 10-fiscal year rolling window. By default, all the values are selected. The EDWPresentation database refreshes daily and reflects data through the end of the previous day. By default, all the values are selected. How is the pool of research expenditure data determined? The data displayed in this dashboard are only the sponsored research-related subset of all UW expenditures. To identify whether an expenditure is spent in the pursuit of sponsored research, we examine budget attributes including the Super Class, Fund Group, Budget Type, Budget Class, Reporting Function, Function/Sub-Function, Fund Code, and Split Rules. How do you relate expenditures to funding entities (sponsors) using SAGE data? We were able to relate funding entities to expenditures thanks to a data bridge between SAGE award data and FIN expenditures. This mapping relies on a budget, biennium and cross-biennium solution developed by the MyFD team. What is the link between expenditures and Financial Organizations? Research expenditures are linked to Financial Organizations via the Organization Code. Over time, Financial Organization Codes can change, and the associated Campus, College and Department names may change as well. Currently, the research dashboards present associations between research expenditures and Financial Organizations as they existed in the Fiscal Year in which the expenditures occurred. For example, research expenditures in 2008 will be associated with the College of Forest Resources for that year, even though the College was incorporated into the College of the Environment in 2009. This reporting method may also result in apparent duplicates of Departments, as Financial Organization Codes may change over the time range selected. Work is underway to help resolve these reporting irregularities. Are all Financial Organizations included?
