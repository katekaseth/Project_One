Each Grading System may have its own set of Grades to signify different accomplishment or completion levels. The combination of the Grading System and the Grade determines whether or not a student receives Academic Credit for a course. In the case of the Audit Grading System, there is no Grade given and it never awards Academic Credit even after successful completion of the course.::Academic Credit is a basic measure of progress toward the completion of an academic program.

Finals dates are established by the Office of the University Registrar and are based on the first meeting pattern listed in the Time Schedule for that section.&nbsp::Finals are comprehensive exams held after the last day of instruction in a quarter. Faculty are not required to give a final. Finals are given on a per-section basis (i.e. a final covers the material taught in a given section).::A list of course offerings by section for an Academic Quarter. It includesdetails regarding the course sections, such as theinstructors of record,meetingtimes, meeting location,and other details. Instructions regarding how to read theTime Schedule can be foundin the Student Guide.::A Joint Course Limit is an enrollment limit set within the Time Schedule where the individual section limits for a joint loop are ignored and instead the Joint Course Limit controls the combined enrollment across all sections of the joint loop.
In the Time Schedule, there are two ways of controlling the enrollment for a joint loop. For the majority of the joint loops, there is no Joint Course Limit; instead, each individual section has its own limit and when that limit is reached, the section closes, requiring overrides to allow for more students to register.
However, when a Joint Course Limit is set the individual section limits are ignored and all sections remain open until the total enrollment of the loop reaches the Joint Course Limit, at which time, every section in the loop closes.",Time Schedule Information,22
